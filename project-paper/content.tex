\section{Introduction}

Abstract file system provides rest APIs to access different storage systems. 
Along with local system, user data can be stored on other device, or some
spplications like google drive, box.
This segregated data can be accessed by a singe rest service which can
internally call one service per resources. Resources are nothing but the data
storage end points.
