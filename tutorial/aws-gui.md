If everything is reviewed, click `Next` to create user.

##### Step 5: Create User

After Clicking Next: Create User, New user is successfully created. 

If Programmatic access was selected in step 1, user specific access key and
secret key will be displayed on UI. The secret key will be shown only once at
this step.
